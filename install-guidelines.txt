You will have to resolve some minor issues on your own while setting up the environment. I've mentioned the errors I encountered and how to tackle them:

1. pip install earthengine-api (will automatically install google-api-python-client as well)
2. Check for installations of (openssl and pyopenssl) or (pycrypto). pyCrypto is recommended as per documentation.
3. pip install oauth2client
4. Try importing 'ee' module in python. If it shows the error- ImportError: cannot import name 'opentype'
You need to upgrade the pyasn1 module.
5. Uninstalling/Reinstalling pyasn1 will give an error saying it is a disutils installed project and would uninstall partially. Use blockstage command:
pip install --ignore-installed pyasn1
This should install the latest version 0.4.4 and you should be good to go
